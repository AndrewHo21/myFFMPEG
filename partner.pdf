Time/Effort: 4 hours, 5 out of 10
 most time was reading documentation and waiting for installs

Tasks/Problem Solved:
DAY 1 - During install, ffplay was not workign through ssh,
so we decided to install on personal linux machine, and verify that it was running properly
DAY 2 - Located the files that decoded the file types. Added the required text output.
Found specified file types to run the ffmpeg on to test and verified that it was working.
